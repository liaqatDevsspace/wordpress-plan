This WordPress plugin will provide a structured digital catalog for books, including a “Books” custom post type and a hierarchical “Genres” taxonomy. It will expose REST API endpoints to allow programmatic access for creating, reading, updating, and deleting book entries. The plugin will also support AJAX-based frontend features for dynamic book listing and filtering. Administrative users will manage content, while public users can browse books. Payment integration is out of scope for this phase and may be considered in future iterations.
